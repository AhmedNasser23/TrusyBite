This repository contains the implementation of a permissioned blockchain-based fruit supply chain traceability system developed as a graduation project. The system enables authorized stakeholders (farmers, processors, distributors, and retailers) to record supply chain events, which are cryptographically hashed and anchored on an Ethereum-based blockchain.

The system provides a consumer-facing verification interface that allows end users and auditors to verify product authenticity and provenance via QR code scanning, without exposing sensitive operational data.

The project demonstrates the practical application of blockchain, smart contracts, web APIs, and secure data management to address real-world challenges in food safety, traceability, and fraud prevention.
