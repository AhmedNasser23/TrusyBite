# TrusyBite

## Overview
TrusyBite is a permissioned blockchain-based fruit supply chain traceability system developed as a graduation project.  
The system enables transparent, tamper-proof tracking of fruit batches across the supply chain using Ethereum smart contracts.

---

## Problem Statement
Traditional fruit supply chains rely on centralized databases that are vulnerable to data manipulation, lack transparency, and make it difficult for consumers and regulators to verify product authenticity and origin.

---

## Proposed Solution
TrusyBite provides:
- Immutable recording of supply chain events using blockchain
- Cryptographic verification of off-chain data
- Role-based access for supply chain stakeholders
- Read-only public verification for consumers via QR code

Only authorized stakeholders can write data, while consumers can transparently verify product history.

---

## Supply Chain Phases
The prototype covers five phases:
1. Harvest
2. Processing
3. Distribution
4. Retail
5. Consumer / Audit

Each phase records a cryptographically verifiable event.

## License
This project is developed for academic purposes only.
